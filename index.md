FCPP is an efficient C++ implementation of the <i>Field Calculus</i>, for fast and effective simulation of pervasive computing scenarios, large-scale computations on graph-based data, and deployment on microcontroller architectures.

The main source code of the library is available at: [https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp](https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp).
Additional resources (helpers, additional tools, extensions for microcontrollers) are available as repositories in the organization: [https://github.com/fcpp](https://github.com/fcpp).

The online documentation of the API is available at: [http://fcpp-doc.surge.sh](http://fcpp-doc.surge.sh).
Additionally, a general presentation of the tool is available [here](http://giorgio.audrito.info/static/fcpp.pdf) (presented at [ACSOS 2020](https://2020.acsos.org)),
a draft presentation of the graphical user interface is available [here](http://giorgio.audrito.info/static/fcpp-gui.pdf)
and a tutorial integrating the API documentation is under development [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-JduLXnjJIsoRzo7QNiQ8bhcU6DYa3mXAB_hCRl65gU/edit?usp=sharing).

A sample FCPP project is available at: [https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp-sample-project](https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp-sample-project).
This contains sub-projects for every possible application scenario of FCPP, in order to ease the setup of any new project based on the FCPP library.
A quick-start project with a brief guide and exercises is available at: [https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp-exercises](https://github.com/fcpp/fcpp-exercises).
This does not cover every possible application scenario, but is designed to walk through a first approach with FCPP.
